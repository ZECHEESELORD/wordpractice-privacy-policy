            <h2>Automation</h2>
            <p>
                Usage of self-bots, scripts, macros or anything allowing
                automation of commands or typing is against the rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spamming of commands is also not allowed. The spam threshold of our anti-cheat is running 6 or more commands in 8 seconds.

            <h2>Exploiting</h2>
            <p>
                Sharing or using exploits/bugs is strictly forbidden. You must
                report these through the
                <a href="https://discord.com/invite/wordpractice"

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Advertisement</h2>
            <p>
                Usage of the bot to advertise any service not affiliated with
                wordPractice is bannable. This includes advertising via usernames on leaderboards.

                Using any form of OCR or cheating software to gain an unfair
                advantage is against our rules. Distribution of these types of
                software with malicious intent is also forbidden.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sharing accounts to gain an unfair advantage is also considered
